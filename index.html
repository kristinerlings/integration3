                pianos easier, when he
                came up with an idea for a new instrument that used metal reeds and was called the Aura. It was based on
                a small tool
                called a Terpodian and could only play notes when blown into. However, this was just the beginning for

              <p>With the advent of the 19th century, a remarkable innovation was brought forth upon the musical world;
                Joseph
                Richter introduced the first diatonic harmonica. This new iteration was characterised by combination of
                features,
                <span class="semibold">allowing for both blow and draw notes</span> to be played by adding a secnd set
                of reeds. This marked a crucial turning point in the evolution
                of the harmonica, as it paved the way for the modern instrument we know today.
              <p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <p>As the world progressed, so too did the harmonica. It became more refined, eventually
                taking on the form that we know
                and recognise today. It is characterised by its 10 holes and two reed plates, each equipped with 10
                metal reeds.
                Depending on one's location, <span class="semibold">the diatonic harmonica may also be referred to as
                  the "blues harp" in the West, or as the
                  "tremolo harmonica" in the East.</span>

               realised
                that the skills of his clock-making workers could be used to create harmonicas instead.
                So, in 1827, he set up his own workshop and kept his production methods secret for many years. But other
                manufacturers
                soon followed suit, like Christian Weiss who opened his own workshop in 1855. One of the most successful
                of these manufacturers was Matthias Hohner.</p>

              <p>Mattias Hohner was already known as the best clock-maker around, but in 1857, he decided to give up
                clocks and focus
                solely on making harmonicas. Although Matthias Hohner may not have been a skilled harmonica player, he
                possessed a
                natural talent for business and entrepreneurship. He started with a small team, but unlike other
                manufacturers, he
                didn't keep his methods secret and his business grew rapidly.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="txt__wrp--hohner hohner__two">
              <p>Back in those days, harmonicas were made entirely by hand, with each instrument made from start to
                finish by one
                craftsman. The construction of the instrument was in two parts: the body with its cells and the reed
                plate. The wooden
                bodies were roughly cut by knife and then smoothed and filed, and the air channels were cut by hand.
                Metal reeds were
                produced by flattening brass wires to the shape of the reed slots, and brass wire was also used for the
                rivets. The
                primitive instruments were produced with crude tools.</p>

            <div class="txt__wrp--hohner hohner__three">
              <p>But Matthias Hohner was always looking for ways to improve the quality of the instrument. He introduced
                protective
                covers, used his full name as a trademark on the cover plates, and used mass production methods and a
                suitable division
                of labour in his manufacturing processes. He also adopted new methods like rolling instead of hammering
                reed plates and
                using brass instead of lead. In 1880, he even introduced the first steam engine into the factory to
                streamline
                production methods while still maintaining and improving the quality of the instrument.</p>
