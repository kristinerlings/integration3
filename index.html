            <p>The Sheng, a traditional Chinese instrument, is said to have been created by the goddess Nü Wa, who is
              known as the
              creator of all humans.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>Not only can it produce sound while breathing in and out, but it can also play multiple notes at once,
              making it a
              unique and versatile instrument.</p>

        <img class="" src="" alt="" width="" height="">
        <div>
          <p>The Sheng is made of bamboo sticks and has five main parts: the "sheng chest", "mouthpiece", "sheng
            pipes" which are
            placed in the chest with "finger-holes" and reeds placed on each pipe to produce individual notes.</p>

              <div>
                <p>Christian Frederich Buschmann, a German instrument maker, was exploring ways to simplify the tuning of pianos,when he
                created the first harmonica.</p>

              <div>
                <p>The harmonica was called <span class="bold">the Aura</span>, and was inspired by a small device used for tuning, called Terpodians.</p>

        <h2>The Modern Harmonica</h2>
        <div>
          <div>
            <p>Joseph Richter introduced the first diatonic harmonica featuring <span class="bold">both blow and draw notes</span> by adding a second set of
            reeds. This marked a significant turning point in the evolution of the instrument</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>The modern diatonic harmonica, as we know it today, is characterised by its 10 holes and 2 reed plates, each equipped
            with 10 metal reeds. Depending on where you are located, <span class="bold">the diatonic harmonica can be referred as the blues harp in the
            West or as the tremolo harmonica in East..</span></p>
